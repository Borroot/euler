We can see a path as a permutation of moves to the East and moves to the South.
All of the paths for 2x2 are as follows.

	EESS
	ESES
	ESSE
	SEES
	SESE
	SSEE

In order to compute this we just place the E's, the order in which this is done
does not matter and when the E's are placed the S's are automatically also
determined. This gives us the following formula for a NxN grid.

	(2 * N)! / (N! * N!)

So for the 20x20 grid we get.

	(2 * N)! / (N! * N!) = (2 * 20)! / (20! * 20!) = 137846528820
